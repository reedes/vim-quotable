> “Extending Vim to better support ‘typographic’ quote characters.” —Me

While Vim is renown for its text manipulation capabilities, it nevertheless
retains a bias towards ASCII that stretches back to its vi roots on Unix. This
can limit the appeal of this powerful editor for those who prefer typographic
characters like “curly quotes” over "straight quotes" in the prose or
documentation they write.

Features of this plugin:

* Automatic entry of ‘typographic quotes’ from the 'straight quote' keys
* Motion support for typographic quote pairs
* Matchit `%` matching for typographic quote pairs
* User can define alternative typographic quote pairs
* Support for the `tpope/vim-surround` plugin

## Requirements

Requires Vim to be compiled with Unicode support.

A recent version of Vim may be needed to make full use of this plugin.

## Installation

Install using Pathogen, Vundle, Neobundle, or your favorite Vim package
manager.

To support typographic characters as text objects, the following dependency
should be installed. (Strongly recommended.)

* [textobject-user](https://github.com/kana/vim-textobj-user) - a Vim plugin to create your own text objects without pain

## Configuration

Because you won't want typographic quotes in your code, the behavior of this
plugin can be configured per file type. For example, to enable typographic
quote support in `markdown` and `textile` files, place in your `.vimrc`:

  ```vim
  augroup quotable
    autocmd!
    autocmd FileType markdown call quotable#init()
    autocmd FileType textile call quotable#init()
    autocmd FileType python call quotable#init({ 'educate': 0 })
  augroup END
  ```

The last statement installs this plugin for buffers of ‘python’ file type, but
disables the ‘educating’ feature by default. More on that below.

## Usage

### Educating straight quotes

This plugin will ‘educate’ quotes, meaning that it will dynamically transform
your straight quote key presses (["] or [']) into corresponding typographical
quote characters.

For example, entering the following sentence without this plugin using the
straight quote keys looks like this:

  ```
  "I'm still infected," cautioned O'Malley.
  ```

As expected all the quotes are straight ones. But with this plugin, the
straight quotes you enter are transformed into the appropriate typographical
equivalent as you type:

  ```
  “I’m still infected,” cautioned O’Malley.
  ```

However, in some cases you will want to enter a straight quote, such
as:

  ```
  “It snowed 12" overnight,” said Bob, who loathes the metric system.
  ```

To avoid expansion and insert a "straight" quote character, precede key with
`«Ctrl-V»`:

  `«Ctrl-V»"` - straight double quote
  `«Ctrl-V»'` - straight single quote

You can set the educating behavior with the following Ex commands

  ```
  QuotableEducateOn
  QuotableEducateOff
  QuotableEducateToggle
  ```

Or better yet, map to keys:

  ```vim
  nmap <silent> <leader>q1 :QuotableEducateOn<cr>
  nmap <silent> <leader>q0 :QuotableEducateOff<cr>
  nmap <silent> <leader>qq :QuotableEducateToggle<cr>
  ```

### Motion commands

Motion commands are a powerful feature of Vim.

By default, for motion commands, `q` denotes “double” quotes and `Q` denotes
‘single’ quotes.

`ciq` - [Change Inside “double” quotes] - excludes quote chars
`ciQ` - [Change Inside ‘single’ quotes] - excludes quote chars
`caq` - [Change Around “double” quotes] - includes quote chars
`caQ` - [Change Around ‘single’ quotes] - includes quote chars

Apart from `c` for change, you can `v` for visual selection, `d` for deletion,
`y` for yanking to clipboard, etc.

If you don’t like the defaults, you can redefine these by adding the following
to your `.vimrc`, changing the motion characters as you desire:

  ```vim
  let g:quotable#doubleMotion = 'q'
  let g:quotable#singleMotion = 'Q'
  ```

### Matchit support

Matchit enables jumping to matching quotes.

  `%` - jump to the matching typographical quote character

### Surround support

This plugin supports basic surround capabilities. Add to your `.vimrc`:

  ```vim
  " NOTE: be sure to remove these mappings if using the tpope/vim-surround plugin!
  map <silent> Sq <Plug>QuotableSurroundDouble
  map <silent> SQ <Plug>QuotableSurroundSingle
  ```

Then you can use motion commands to surround your text with quotes:

(an asterisk is used to denote the cursor position)

  ```
  visSq     My senten*ce. => “My sentence.”
  visSQ     My senten*ce. => ‘My sentence.’
  ```

Alternatively, if you’ve installed Tim Pope’s [vim-surround][] plugin you also
have replace abilities on pairs of characters:

  ```
  cs'q      'Hello W*orld' => “Hello World”
  cs"q      "Hello W*orld" => “Hello World”
  cs(q      (Hello W*orld) => “Hello World”
  cs(Q      (Hello W*orld) => ‘Hello World’
  ```

### Entering special characters

Sometimes you will have to enter special characters (like typographical quotes)
manually, such as in a search expression. You can do so through Vim’s digraphs
or via your operating system’s keyboard shortcuts.

| Glyph | Digraph | OS X             | Description
| ----- | ------- | ---------------- | ----------------------------
| ‘     | '6      | Opt-`]`          | left single quotation mark
| ’     | '9      | Shift-Opt-`]`    | right single quotation mark
| “     | "6      | Opt-`[`          | left double quotation mark
| ”     | "9      | Shift-Opt-`[`    | right double quotation mark
| ‚     | .9      |                  | single low-9 quote
| „     | :9      | Shift-Opt-w      | double low-9 quote
| ‹     | 1<      | Opt-\            | left pointing single quotation mark
| ›     | 1>      | Shift-Opt-\      | right pointing single quotation mark
| «     | <<      | Opt-\            | left pointing double quotation mark
| »     | >>      | Shift-Opt-\      | right pointing double quotation mark
| –     | -N      | Opt-hyphen       | en dash
| —     | -M      | Shift-Opt-hyphen | em dash
| …     | ..      | Opt-;            | horizontal ellipsis
| ï     | i:      | Opt-U i          | lowercase i, umlaut
| æ     | ae      | Opt-'            | lowercase ae

For example, to enter left double quotation mark (“), precede the digraph code
("6) with Ctrl-K, like

  ```
  «Ctrl-K»"6
  ```

Alternatively, if you’re on OS X, you can enter Opt-`[` to enter this
character.

For more details, see:

  `:help digraphs`

## International support

Many international keyboards feature keys to allow you to input the desired
typographic quote directly. In such cases, you won’t need to change the
behavior of the straight quote keys.

But if you do, a standard convention is used by default:

  ```vim
  let g:quotable#doubleDefault = '“”'     " “double”
  let g:quotable#singleDefault = '‘’'     " ‘single’
  ```

Those users editing all of their prose in German may want to change their
defaults to:

  ```vim
  let g:quotable#doubleDefault = '„“'     " „doppel“
  let g:quotable#singleDefault = '‚‘'     " ‚einzel‘
  ```

International users who desire maximum control can switch between quote
pairings within a single buffer:

  ```vim
  nmap <silent> <leader>qd :call quotable#init()<cr>    " forces defaults
  nmap <silent> <leader>qs :call quotable#init({ 'double':'“”', 'single':'‘’' })<cr>
  nmap <silent> <leader>qg :call quotable#init({ 'double':'„“', 'single':'‚‘' })<cr>
  nmap <silent> <leader>qx :call quotable#init({ 'double':'„”', 'single':'‚’' })<cr>
  nmap <silent> <leader>qf :call quotable#init({ 'double':'«»', 'single':'‹›' })<cr>
  ```

## Future development

This plugin can benefit from additional work. Perhaps you can help?

* Vim doc file
* Better support for motion
* Better support for vim-surround
* Commands for converting text between typographic and typewriter characters
* Right to left support

If you have any ideas on improving this plugin, please post them to the github project issue page.
